      <h2>What is Anime?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from
          Japan. Anime differs from other animated cartoons due to its unqiue
          art style. Anime is easily identifiable by it's typical art style
          (large eyes, untamed hair, lengthy arms and limbs, etc.) Anime has
          vastly grown in popularity over the years and continues to grow with
          popular anime series such as One Piece that is celebrated over 1,000
          episodes and has been going on since 1999!
